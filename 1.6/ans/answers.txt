- _Atomic vs volatile

Volatile - directive to prevent optimizations for variables that can change unexpectedly
         - its value can be read or modified asynchronously by something other than the current thread of execution.
         - may spontaneously change for reasons 

In C, the volatile keyword was intended to:
    - Allow access to memory-mapped I/O devices.
    - Allow preserving values across a longjmp.
    - Allow sharing values between signal handlers and the rest of the program in volatile sig_atomic_t objects.

NOTE: operations on volatile variables in C are NOT atomic


ATOMIC - provides thread-safe operations and memory guarantees for concurrent programming
       - Ensures operations on a variable are indivisible (atomic) and thread-safe.
